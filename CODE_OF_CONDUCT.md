# Code of Conduct

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences, even when disagreeing 
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members, including recognizing that this is a volunteer-led open source project
* Using welcoming and inclusive language
  * For example, if you are asking for input from individuals in a channel discussion on Slack, posting “hey guys, what do you think about XYZ?” may be confusing for some individuals as to whether their input is solicited or welcome. A less confusing and more inclusive approach might instead be “hey all, what do you think about XYZ?”. If you are intending to solicit a subgroup’s opinions, consider tagging the individuals directly in your question or comment. 

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal insults or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a private physical or e-mail address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which would be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
* Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior
* Repeated unwanted behavior targeted at an individual. If someone asks you to stop, then stop.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces, including activity and interactions on GitHub, all other TCN Coalition-related spaces (e.g. Slack), and on platforms and social media such as Twitter, etc. when engaging with other TCN Coalition participants or on TCN Coalition-related content.

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior they become aware of.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting Andreas Gebhard, Dana Lewis or Jenny Wanger. If a situation arises where you are uncomfortable (due to a perceived conflict of interest or otherwise) contacting Andreas, Dana or Jenny, please feel free to contact another senior member of the TCN Coalition team, such as Harper Reed or Nele Quast.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.
